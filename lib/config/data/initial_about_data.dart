I specialize in creating cross-platform mobile applications that are fast, reliable and user-friendly. 
I have over three years of experience in cross-platform development and one year in full-stack development, using various frameworks and languages such as Flutter, Dart, JavaScript, Kotlin and PHP.

I have participated in the development of eight projects in different domains, such as restaurant services, fitness, trading, education, and hiring, delivering workable solutions that meet the clients needs and expectations.

I also have knowledge of backend services, web development, server installation and maintenance and SEO. 

I am passionate about learning new technologies and skills, and I enjoy experimenting and sharing my projects on GitHub (karlen96). I have also earned multiple certifications in Flutter and Kotlin from Coursera.
